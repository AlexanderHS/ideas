- Charging Stations
  - convenient and low cost charging anywhere for laptops, phones, ebikes, cars?
  - scenario: ebike in small country town/train station part way through 4 day bikepacking adventure. asking a stanger to use their power point or offering them money for it is awkward but need is real. sometimes consider offering to pay for accomodation that we don't need just to have access to power.
- consulting? http://unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html
- wish there was a way to get anon reviews from prior tenants about rentals/agents
  -  problem is no incentive to share since negative reviews are likely traceable and rental agents likely to search for them
